# reactjsoc-examples

These are the examples from the first [ReactJS-OC](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-OC/) meetup held on June 9, 2015. The presentation slides
can be found on my [blog](http://locnguyen.github.io/up-and-running-with-reactjs/).

## Usage
If you have a Node environment set up you can run `npm install` from the project root and then `npm start`. That
will start a web server that you can access at http://localhost:9000. If you don't have a Node environment you can just
open examples/index.html and it should still work fine.
